# Nim-REPL-Template
Just a template for implementing a REPL in Nim. Probably not optimal, but it works (on my system at least)

I'd imagine this can be flushed out a lot further if you expand the 'commands.json' file to have different categories of commands as opposed to one standard type and implement function calls in one way or another.
You're smart, you'll figure it out.

We're all gonna make it, bros
